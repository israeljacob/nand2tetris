# Project List

## Project 7: VM I: Stack Arithmetic

Description: This project focuses on implementing stack arithmetic operations for a virtual machine. It involves designing and implementing the necessary instructions and algorithms to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more using a stack-based approach.

## Project 8: VM II: Program Control

Description: In this project, the focus shifts to program control in the virtual machine. It involves designing and implementing instructions and algorithms for branching, conditional statements, loops, and other control flow structures. The goal is to enable the execution of complex programs within the virtual machine environment.

## Project 9: High-Level Language

Description: Project 9 introduces a high-level language that can be used to write programs for the virtual machine. It involves designing and implementing a language parser, syntax analyzer, and code generation components. The project aims to enable programmers to write programs in a more human-readable and expressive language, which can then be translated into the virtual machine's low-level instructions.
I chose to implement the 2048 game.

## Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis

Description: Project 10 focuses on building a compiler for a high-level language. It involves implementing the syntax analysis phase, which includes lexical analysis, parsing, and constructing an abstract syntax tree (AST). The project aims to translate source code written in the high-level language into a form that can be executed by the virtual machine.

## Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation

Description: Project 11 extends the compiler by implementing the code generation phase. It involves translating the AST generated in the previous project into low-level instructions that can be executed by the virtual machine. The project focuses on efficient code generation techniques, optimization strategies, and generating executable code that closely matches the intended behavior of the high-level language.

## Racket
These projects were implemented using the Racket programming language. 

Racket is a general-purpose programming language that belongs to the Lisp/Scheme family. It provides a rich set of features for functional programming, macros, and language extensibility. 

Racket is known for its emphasis on language-oriented programming and its support for developing domain-specific languages (DSLs). It offers a powerful development environment and has a strong community of users and contributors.
